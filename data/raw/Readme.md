## üöÄ How to Use This Data

1.  **Download:** Click on each file name from the official data page (link above).
2.  **Extract:** Unzip each file to obtain the CSV files.
3.  **Place in Project Structure:** Move the extracted CSV files to the `/data/raw/` directory of this project.
4.  **Run the Code:** Execute the `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to process the data and load it into the SQLite database. The SQL queries in this folder can then be run on that database.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note on File Size

The original CSV files are very large (over 5 GB combined) and are therefore not included in this GitHub repository. This is a standard practice to keep the repository efficient and manageable.
